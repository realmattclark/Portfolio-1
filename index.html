    <p> My name is Matthew Clark. I come from the small town of Buhler, KS. I graduated from Hutchinson Community College with an Associate's Degree and attended Kansas State University from 2016-2018. I decided that I wanted to become a web developer and moved to Kansas City hoping to begin my new career!</p>
    <p> Currently, I am bartending at Houlihan's Overland Park. I enjoy bartending because it gives me a chance to meet new people and face new challenges every day. I have been a bartender for 2 years and am a certified Cicerone which is comprehensive knowledge of beer, different styles, and the brewing process in general. </p>
    <p> Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my dog Wrigley (not related to the Cubs), exploring the outdoors, golfing, and being with my family and friends.</p>
